# Bracket Revival | [**Wiki**](https://github.com/kitodoescode/Bracket/wiki)
- Hi, I am attempting to revive this old roblox user-interface library since its original owner had abandoned it a long time ago.
- Please feel free to star the repository and make pull requests for any issues that you may find!
- I will try my best to continue this library with complete documentation for each version and completing the v3.4 source aswell as future updates, adding more features and possibly a v4.
